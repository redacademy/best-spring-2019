# Best Project 
 Best is a community group project for a real client, it is a non profit organization with long history of promoting sustainable transportation. The project first went through UX and UI design process. After extensive research and design process and on the basis of the mock up we developers created the website according to the design. It is formatted to view in mobile and desktop. The webite is created from scratch we created our own custom themes by forking redstarter and it is wordpress based.

 ##Time-line

Time-line was perhaps the most difficult part of the project the expectation was to create a timeline according to their history, so listing down each year and on click a pop-up appears in the center. The timeline itself looks like a branch required heavy css and javacripts to achieve its final form. The time-line appears only in the history page. 

 
 ##Programs

 In the program page, six programs are displayed in grid which contains image and title. On hover in each program displays out brief info regarding the specific program with a button linked to visit external site. 




 
 
 ##Tabs

Tabs can be seen through-out resouces and get involved page required to custom-field to implement in the program. So whenever the user clicks the tabs it is underlined and outputs the content accordin to its title question. 




 ## Learnings
  The project was challenging because it was a group project it required extensive amount of planning, strategizing, and communination. After mastering git version control be assumed this would be less issue but however we encountered merge conflicts very often and spend resolving it. Other challenges include creating the timeline which was fairly new for us to execute and implementing the design and functionality. Another challenge and learning was using custom-field suite to fetch data and having different data be display on hover. We also have to style for mobile and desktop which were radically little different from each other than usual. For example for the header contains a hamburger menu and the logo in centered during the mobile and in desktop their is no hamburger menu and logo moves to the left.
